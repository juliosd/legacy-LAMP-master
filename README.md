## LabFellows Legacy Site

This website is a highly-hacked WordPress and powers the forntend of LabFellows.com. It was created by Julio and several paid independent contractors for legacy marketplace functionality.

Why include the entire WordPress codebase in this repo, you ask? Because I needed to replicate the codebase exactly as it was on the server, and there are a number of plugins and themes involved here, plus we have no documentation and thus don't know if any modifications were made to the WP core. So to be safe I brought them all in.
